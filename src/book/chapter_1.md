Heavy Inventories is a groundbreaking Minecraft addon designed to introduce a rich and immersive gameplay mechanic 
centered around item weight. Inspired by the weight system from Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls series, Heavy Inventories 
brings a new level of challenge and realism to your Minecraft experience. This book serves as both the official 
documentation for Heavy Inventories and a comprehensive research paper detailing the logic and methodology behind the 
creation of the Heavy Inventories Weight Engine.

## The Need for a Weight System
Minecraft, a game known for its limitless creativity and exploration, traditionally lacks a weight system for inventory 
management. Players can carry an almost infinite number of items, which, while convenient, detracts from the game's 
realism and strategic depth. The introduction of a weight system addresses this gap, compelling players to make more 
thoughtful decisions about what to carry, enhancing the game's challenge and immersion.

## Features and Functionality
Heavy Inventories is not just a simple weight addon; it is a feature-rich, seamless integration into the Minecraft 
ecosystem. At its core, the mod uses advanced machine learning algorithms to determine the weight of every item registered 
in the game. This dynamic and intelligent approach ensures that the weight values are balanced and realistic, adapting 
to the vast array of items and their variations within the game.

## The Heavy Inventories Weight Engine
The heart of Heavy Inventories lies in its Weight Engine, a sophisticated system that generates, reads, and writes JSON 
files to store weight data for all items. This engine utilizes machine learning models to calculate valid weights, making 
it a robust and adaptable solution. The Weight Engine's ability to process and update item weights in real-time ensures 
that the gameplay remains consistent and fair, even as new items are introduced or existing items are modified.

## Inspiration and Design Philosophy
Heavy Inventories draws significant inspiration from the weight systems used in The Elder Scrolls series, renowned for 
their balance and impact on gameplay. The design philosophy behind Heavy Inventories is to provide a similar sense of 
realism and strategic challenge. By implementing a weight system, players are encouraged to consider the consequences of 
their inventory choices, fostering a deeper engagement with the game world.

## Structure
This book is divided into two main parts:

### Documentation: 
This section provides detailed instructions on how to install, configure, and use Heavy Inventories. It covers everything 
from initial setup to advanced customization options, ensuring that users of all skill levels can fully utilize the addon.

### Research Paper: 
This section delves into the technical aspects of the Heavy Inventories Weight Engine. It explores the machine learning 
models used, the algorithms for weight calculation, and the methods for data storage and retrieval. Additionally, it 
discusses the challenges faced during development and the solutions implemented to overcome them.
