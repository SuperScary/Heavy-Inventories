# Heavy Inventories
Heavy Inventories is a machine learning mechanics based mod that dynamically creates weights for items. When a player is carrying
an item, that weight is added to their carry weight, causing them to need to take care of what they bring with them! This 
system is inspired by TESV: Skyrim, which adds a more realistic RPG element to the game.

## Features
- Dynamically generated item weights
- Fully configurable down to each item
- Beautiful and customizable in-game GUI

## Who this is for
Heavy Inventories is for players looking for a more realistic experience while adding a level of difficulty to their 
survival world. 

## FAQ
Q: How are weights generated?
A: While not every possibility or material can be accounted for, Heavy Inventories takes into account base recipe materials
and creates a weight that would make the most sense for an item.

Q: What is stone?
A: Stone is the weight measuring system used by Heavy Inventories. It has no relation to the British system of Stone.

Q: Do I still need SuperCore?
A: No, SuperCore was a legacy way to generate mod constants from class files. The methods used are no longer supported in 
a modded environment.

Q: What loaders/versions are supported? 
A: Currently, only NeoForge for Minecraft 1.21 is supported. There are no plans at this time to back-port to older versions
of Minecraft or other Loaders.
